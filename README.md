PopCoin
============
POPCOIN is a payment platform that connects payers and payees, in an extremely fast and convenient way . The fundamental feature of the app is the abílity to sync with your facebook account so that it can access your friend list and the list of events that you are going to.
POPCOIN has 3 main functions: 
 - Paying money
 - Requesting money 
 - Selling events
  
 Two sub functions are the notifìcation system and the recent activity bar;  you can see the notification icon on the right top corner.

The first function is the PAY. We introduce an extremely more convenient payment process comparing with the current process. You may complete a payment in less than 10 seconds. Firstly, you click on the empty icon to choose the person you want to pay for, from your friendlist. Then you input the amount you want to pay him. You may send him a message if you like. Slide to pay. You can verify your payment using either your net bank code, or you can even use fingerprint. The fingerprint would be a future development.

The second function is the REQUEST. This allows you to request payment from a person that owe you someone, without verbal contact. It is quite similar to the Pay function, except that you don’t have to verify your request. Additionally, you can also select to charge a group of people. Using this function, you can easily split money between a group of friends. It’s an extremely fast and convénient way to share a restaurant receipt between friends or to organize a poker night.
When you pay or request money from a person, the system will push a notification to their app. They can check the notes to see who are charging and paying them. So no embárrassing moment, no losing money anymore.

The third function is the Event seller. Here, you can find all of the events that you joined on FB. If you are the host of the event, you may collect coins from Event members, in a pop. You have 3 options: REQUEST MONEY, REQUEST DONATION, or SELLING TICKET, depending on the purpose of the event. Basically, request money works similarly to function to Request money from a group, but with a large number of people. On the other hand, the request donation function let people decide the amount they want to donate. This function allow you to make donation, crowd funding, fundraising in just a few steps.
